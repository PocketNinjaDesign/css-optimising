# css-optimising
Just a playground for messing around with npm plugins for CSS.



    $ gulp



### to run the default build

 1. compiles SASS
 2. autoprefixes CSS
 3. minifies CSS
 4. copies to public/CSS



    $ gulp all



### to run the full build

 1. runs default
 2. (optional) copies contents of public to chosen folder


For option 2 simply uncomment the localDir line and add any folder pathname.  The main goal being, you can build to a sibling public folder and a locahost for sites using PHP, JAVA etc.
